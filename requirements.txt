# Pinned dependencies for CI/CD reproducibility
# Generated for NetSmith production builds
# 
# To update: 
#   1. Update pyproject.toml with new version ranges
#   2. Run: pip-compile requirements.in (if using pip-tools)
#   3. Or manually pin based on pyproject.toml ranges

# Core dependencies (from pyproject.toml)
numpy>=1.23,<3.0.0
scipy>=1.9,<2.0.0

# Note: This file uses version ranges from pyproject.toml
# For production deployments, consider using pip-tools to generate
# fully pinned versions: pip-compile requirements.in
#
# Dev dependencies are in pyproject.toml under [project.optional-dependencies.dev]
# Optional dependencies (pandas, polars, networkx) are in pyproject.toml
